**CIA Triad**
	Confidentiality
		-Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to those who are authorized to view or use it. It involves protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or interception. Measures such as encryption, access controls, and data classification help maintain confidentiality.

	Integrity
		-Integrity ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. It involves protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption. Techniques such as checksums, digital signatures, and access controls help verify data integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.
		
	Avaliability
		-Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users. It involves maintaining continuous and reliable access to systems, networks, and data, even in the face of disruptions or attacks. Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans, and fault-tolerant systems are used to maximize availability and minimize downtime.




**Non-Repudiation**
	-Enforcing the inability of a subject to deny that they participated in a digital transaction, agreement, contract, or communication such as an email.
	-Non-repudiation is the property of agreeing to adhere to an obligation
		-More specifically, it is the inability to refute responsibility.


**Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**

	Authentication
		-the process of validating that an entity (user, application, or system) is who or what they claim to be

	Authorization
		-the process of granting an authenticated entity permission to acccess a resource or perform a specific function

	Accounting
		-basically, when did the entity begin, when did it end, and how long did they do it?

	**Character vs Packet Mode**

		-Character Mode
			-In networking, character mode refers to a method of data transmission where individual characters or bytes are sent and received sequentially. Each character is transmitted independently, and there is no inherent structure or formatting imposed on the data stream.

		-Packet Mode
			-Packet mode, also known as packet-switched mode, is a method of data transmission where data is organized into packets before being transmitted over a network. Each packet contains both data and control information, including source and destination addresses, error checking codes, and sequencing information.
