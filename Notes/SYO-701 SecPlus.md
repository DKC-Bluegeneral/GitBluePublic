# Gap Analysis


- Know where you are, and where you need to go.


## Common gaps:


- Weak credentials or shared credentials
- Lack of tested patch management
- Violation of least privilege principle
- Having no/unenforced acceptable use policies
- Poor physical security
- Configuration and deployment errors due to lack of change and configuration management
- Poor visibility and lack of proper auditing





# Zero trust control plane





## Zero Trust (ZT):


- ZT assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets to user accounts based solely on their physical or network location based on asset ownership. 

- Segregation of duties and high visibility are also emphasized 

- Adaptive identity is another key ZT component. Itâ€™s also called adaptive authentication, or risk based authentication. It is  a method of access to data that matches user credentials with the risk of the requested authorization. 

- Zero Trust Control Plane is separate from the data plane, and contains the policy decision point (PDP), which includes:
The Policy engine (PE), which uses the enterprise policy-driven access control panel (as well as input from external sources) to grant, deny, or revoke access to resources. 
The policy administrator (PA) which enables or shuts down the communication path between subject and a resource  via commands to associated policy enforcement points (PEPs)

- The PA communicates with the PEP when creating the communication path via the control plane. 





# CIA Triad





## Confidentiality


- Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to those who are authorized to view or use it. It involves protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or interception. Measures such as encryption, access controls, and data classification help maintain confidentiality.


## Integrity


- Integrity ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy throughout its life-cycle. It involves protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption. Techniques such as checksum, digital signatures, and access controls help verify data integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.


## Availability


- Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users. It involves maintaining continuous and reliable access to systems, networks, and data, even in the face of disruptions or attacks. Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans, and fault-tolerant systems are used to maximize availability and minimize downtime.


### Non-Repudiation


- Enforcing the inability of a subject to deny that they participated in a digital transaction, agreement, contract, or communication such as an email.

- Non-repudiation is the property of agreeing to adhere to an obligation

- More specifically, it is the inability to refute responsibility.





# Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting





## Authentication


- The process of validating that an entity (user, application, or system) is who or what they claim to be

## Authorization


- The process of granting an authenticated entity permission to access a resource or perform a specific function

## Accounting


- Basically, when did the entity begin, when did it end, and how long did they do it?





# Character vs Packet Mode





## Character Mode


- In networking, character mode refers to a method of data transmission where individual characters or bytes are sent and received sequentially. Each character is transmitted independently, and there is no inherent structure or formatting imposed on the data stream.


## Packet Mode


- Packet mode, also known as packet-switched mode, is a method of data transmission where data is organized into packets before being transmitted over a network. Each packet contains both data and control information, including source and destination addresses, error checking codes, and sequencing information.





# Authorization Models





## DAC (Discretionary Access Control):


- Discretionary Access Control grants access controls decisions to the resource owners and custodians.

- Each resource typically has an owner who determines the access permissions and shares.

- The owner can grand or revoke access rights for other users or groups.

- DAC is flexible and allows owners to have fine grained control over access, but it can also result in inconsistant access control desisions.

- **MOST PRONE TO PRIVELEGE CREEP**


## RBAC (Role-based Access Control):


- Grants access based on predefined job role or title.

- Users are assigned roles, and access rights and are associated with these roles.

- Instead of directly assigning permissions to individual users, permissions are assigned to roles, and users inherit the access rights associated with their assigned roles, for example:

	- Various Roles in a hospital or medical center

	- Built-in roles in a database management system

	- RBAC streamlines access control administration by grouping users with similar job functions and offering scalable approach to access management.

	- Can be mixed with other models for ease of use


## MAC (Mandatory Access Control):


- A Strict mathematical model where access to resources is determined by the system based on predefined security labels and rules.


- Principals are assigned security clearances or classification levels (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Etc.)


- Resource objects are labeled with sensitivity levels

- Access is granted or denied by comparing these labels and rules, ensuring strict control and preventing unauthorized access.

- This is a "Non -Discretionary" model:

	- A non-discretionary model refers to a security policy where access control decisions are determined by system administrators or security administrators rather than by individual users.

	- In non-discretionary models, users do not have the discretion to modify or override access control settings for resources.

	- Access decisions are typically based on predefined rules, such as security labels or classifications assigned to users and resources, rather than on user-defined permissions.

	- This approach helps enforce strict access controls and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.


## ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control):


- Grants access based on a combination of characteristics associated with users, resources, and environmental conditions. 

- Attributes could include:

	- User Attributes (Job Title, Department, Etc)

	- Resource Attributes (Sensitivity level, classification, etc.)

	- Environmental attributes (time of access, location, etc.).

- Authorization policies are defined using these combinations, and decisions are made based on evaluating the attributes against the defined policies.


## ABDAC (Attribute-based dynamic access control):


- Combines principals of ABDAC and DAC.

- Considers dynamic factors such as risk assessment, user attributes, resource attributes, and contextual information to make access control decisions in real time.

- ABDAC provides more fine-grained and context-aware access control needed in "zero-trust" environments when compared to other more static access control models.

- May include dynamic machine learning techniques such as user behavioral analytics (UBA) in next generation environments. 


## RBAC (Rule-based Access Control):


- Access control rules define conditions or criteria that must be met for access to be granted.

- Rules can be based on several factors, such as user attributes, resource attributes, time of access, and more.





# Control Categories





## Technical Controls:


- These controls involve the use of technology to protect information systems, networks, and data. Examples include:

	- Firewalls, encryption, access controls, antivirus software, IDS, SIEM, and SOAR.


## Managerial Controls:


- These controls focus on policies, procedures, and administrative measures to manage and oversee security within an organization. Examples include:

	- Security policies, risk management processes, security training and awareness programs, and incident response plans.


## Operational Controls:


- These controls deal with the day-to-day operational aspects of security, including the implementation and enforcement of security policies and procedures. Examples include:

	- Access control procedures, backup and recovery processes, change management procedures, and system monitoring.


## Physical Controls:


- These controls involve measures to protect physical assets, facilities, and resources from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. Examples include:

	- Locks and keys, access control systems, surveillance cameras, perimeter fencing, and environmental controls such as fire suppression systems.





# Control Types





## Preventive Controls:


- These controls aim to prevent security incidents from occurring by implementing measures that stop or minimize the likelihood of threats and vulnerabilities being exploited. Examples include:

	- Firewalls, access control lists, encryption, and security awareness training.


## Deterrent Controls:


- Deterrent controls are intended to discourage potential attackers from attempting to exploit vulnerabilities by increasing the perceived risk or effort required. Examples include:

	- Security signage, visible security cameras, and security patrols.


## Detective Controls:


- Detective controls are used to identify and detect security incidents or breaches after they have occurred. These controls help in monitoring and alerting security teams to abnormal or suspicious activities. Examples include:

	- Intrusion detection systems, security logs and auditing, and security incident response teams.


## Corrective Controls:


- Corrective controls are implemented to mitigate the impact of security incidents and restore systems to their normal functioning state. These controls aim to address the root cause of the issue and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Examples include:

	- System backups, patch management, and incident response procedures.


## Compensating Controls:


- Compensating controls are alternative measures implemented to provide an equivalent level of security when primary controls cannot be implemented or are ineffective. These controls help in mitigating risks and maintaining security posture. Examples include:

	- Multi-factor authentication, compensating controls for legacy systems, and security monitoring tools.


## Directive Controls:


- Directive controls establish policies, guidelines, and procedures to direct behavior and actions within an organization to ensure compliance with security objectives. These controls provide guidance on security requirements and expectations for employees and stakeholders. Examples include:

	- Security policies, standards, and procedures, security training programs, and access control policies.





# Privilege Escalation





- This is more of a phase for a multi-stage attack, not just an attack it's self. 

- Privilege escalation can occur during the attack, part of the kill chain, or during pen-testing

- Can be vertical or horizontal.

- APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) often attempt an escalation of access privileges soon after the initial compromise phase. 

- The goal is to become the root/admin user on the device

- Least privilege is key

- Having current versions of all software (OS, applications, etc) can help mitigate this.

- SUID (Set User ID `SUDO`) It is a special permission in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of the file's owner or group, rather than with the permissions of the user who is executing it.





# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)




- **XSS**

	- Flaws in pages rendered by web servers and not the web server code itself (i.e. Apache, IIS) where malicious scripts or code are injected into trusted or innocent web site pages.

	- Malicious scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data stored by the browser and used with the site.

	- Attacker typically sends browser-side scripts to end user.

	- Can occur anytime a web program uses user input within the output it generates without validating or encoding.


## XSS Types:


- **DOM (Document Object Model) Based XSS (Local or Type 0):**

	- In this type of XSS attack, the malicious script is injected and executed client-side by modifying the DOM  directly.

		- Example: An attacker modifies the URL parameter `?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` on a vulnerable webpage. The script modifies the DOM to display an alert when the page loads, executing the attack on the user's browser.

- **Reflected XSS (Non-persistent or Type 1):**

	- In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious script is embedded in a URL or input field, and the server reflects the injected script back to the user's browser without proper validation or encoding.

		- Example: An attacker crafts a phishing email containing a link to a vulnerable website with the payload `http://vulnerable-site.com/?search=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When the victim clicks the link and the search parameter is reflected on the page without sanitation, the script is executed in the victim's browser.

- **Stored XSS (Persistent or Type 2):**

	- Stored XSS occurs when the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, typically in a database or user-generated content, and is then served to other users who access the affected page.

		- Example: An attacker posts a malicious script as a comment on a blog or forum, such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When other users visit the page containing the comment, the script executes in their browsers, potentially compromising their accounts or stealing sensitive information.


## Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)


- Attack forces an end user to perform undesirable actions in a web application in which they are authenticated

	- An effective CSRF/XSRF attack can force users to perform state-changing requests such as:

		- Transferring Funds

		- Changing their E-Mail address

		- Changing their password

- If a victim is an admin account, the CSRF attack can compromise the entire web application. 


# Injection Attacks


- Often a result of MITM (Man in the middle) or RAT (Remote Access Tool).

- Malware can inject false MAC or IP addresses.

- DLL injection is where malicious code forces its-self to run in place of other benign code.

- This "Injected" code is usually code written by a third party developer, designed to perform some malicious function


## SQL Injection


- Involves inserting a SQL query through input data from client to server application and can allow for several exploits. 

	- Read from sensitive data

		`SELECT FROM`

	- Change database data

		`INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`

	- Execute administrative functions 

		`shutdown DBMS`

	- Run commands on an operating system


## LDAP Injection (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)


- Often used in web applications over the internet or a corporate intranet

- The web applications take the input from the client in order to process it further, so the attacker exploits the data not being properly sanitized or going directly to a back-end database. 

- The attacks can render sensitive user information or change information in the LDAP directory. 


## XML Injection


- Also known as "SOAP Injection"

- User input is inserted unsafely

- XML meta-characters can be used to modify

- Can interfere with application logic

- Performs unauthorized tasks or accessible data. 





# Targeted Coding Attacks





## Pointer/object de-reference

- An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the program is not expecting

- A Null-pointer de-reference occurs when a pointer with a value of NULL is used as if it actually points to a valid memory area

- A program can possibly de-reference a null pointer, and in doing so, raise a NullPointerException

- Null pointer errors are frequently the result of one or more programmer assumptions being violated. 

## Directory Traversal

- Also known as a path transversal attack or a "Dot Slash" and is most often launched through a web browser and other clients.

- This HTTP exploit allows and attacker to access restricted files, directories, and commands located outside of the root directory

- Attackers can modify a URI or URL to force the web server into exposing the restricted files.

	- Examples Include:

		![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DKC-Bluegeneral/Notes/main/Images/Dir-Transversal-Example-1.png)


## Buffer and Integer overflows


- **Buffer Overflows**

	- Attacker Sends larger than expected input, for example when a server accepts it and writes to memory areas.

	- Associated buffers are filled and adjacent memory is overwritten as a result.

	- This overwrite may contain instructions or code that crashes the server resulting in a DoS.

- **Integer Overflows**

	- A Type of an arithmetic overflow error when the result of an integer operation does not fit  within the allocated memory space.

	- Instead of an error in the program, it usually causes the result to be unexpected.

	- These are in the top 10 of the most dangerous software errors, mostly because they often lead to buffer overflows.

## Race Conditions - time of check/time of use

- **Race Condition**

	- A race condition is when a system or software tries to do two or more things simultaneously, but due to the type of system, the operations must be done in the correct sequence in order or function properly.

	- Race conditions are classically related to synchronization errors in software code.

	- Crackers can leverage a known race condition vulnerability to get unauthorized access to a system or network.

- **Time-Of-Check vs. Time-Of-Use (TOC/TOU)**

	- A time-of-check vs time-of-use attack is a race condition and occurs when an attacker tries to gain privilege to a system by "racing" it to a resource it is attempting to access.

	- The types of programming flaws that allow for race conditions occur when the system (or application) splits up the operations of verifying credentials and providing access to a resource.

	- It can do things such as replacing a config.sys file with a different file that compromises the system before the system even loads it's operating system.

- **Improper error handling**

	- Poorly defined validation rules used in verifying the correctness, completeness, and acceptability of input data.

	- Software applications and web servers are notorious

	- Must establish data input, data flow, and data output requirements with a designed security features in mind.

	- Collisions are in this category when the chance that two unique inputs will produce the same output (MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable)

- **Session replay attacks**

	- Often part of MITM attacks.

		- Examples include:

			- An attacker steals an ID of a user and reuses it to impersonate an authorized user.

			- Web applications that allow reusing old session ID's or session credentials for authorization are also vulnerable to these attacks.

	- IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) have anti-replay mechanisms to protect secure session.





# API Attacks




- Application Programming Interface Attacks:

	- An API DDoS attack often involves sending traffic from many clients to overwhelm the API service

	- Even if rate limiting controls are in place to prevent servers from crashing, they cannon always prevent service disruption and severe degradation of the API's user expierence.

	- If API calls are not digitally signed or if they have embedded credentials, they can be compromised.


## API Attack Vectors

- Login Attacks

	- Login attacks involve attempting to gain unauthorized access to an application or system by exploiting weaknesses in the authentication mechanism. This may include brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or phishing attacks targeting user credentials.

- DDoS Attacks

	- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks aim to disrupt the normal operation of an application or service by overwhelming it with a large volume of traffic from multiple sources. This flood of traffic consumes the target's resources, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.

- Leverage Credentials

	- Attackers may leverage stolen or compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to an application or system. This could involve using leaked credentials obtained from data breaches or phishing attacks to impersonate legitimate users and access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

- MITM (Man in the Middle)

	- MITM attacks involve intercepting and potentially modifying communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. In the context of APIs, MITM attacks may target the communication between clients and servers, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data or manipulate the transmitted messages.





# SSL Striping and Pass the Hash





## Pass the Hash

- Example:

	- Let's say an attacker gains access to a system and retrieves the hashed password of a privileged user. Instead of cracking the hash to obtain the plaintext password, the attacker can use the hashed password directly to authenticate to other systems where the same password is used. By passing the hashed password, the attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to additional systems within the network without needing the actual password. This method bypasses traditional authentication mechanisms that rely on verifying plaintext passwords, making it a powerful technique for attackers to escalate their privileges and move laterally within the network.

	- On Windows networks, hackers do not need the plaintext passwords to access certain services.

	- Sometimes the authentication process relies on the passwords cryptographic hash and there are various tools to extract these hashes (Cain) from compromised Windows machines (Lately Windows 10) and use them to access other services.

	- This technique is known as pass the hash and is one of the attacks that windows Virtual Secure Module (VSM) was intended to protect against.

- By definition a Pass the Hash is a vulnerability of Windows Safe Mode.

	- It is an OS diagnostic mode of operation that has been around since windows 95

	- It can be initiated at the boot time and only loads the nominal set of drivers and services that windows needs to run.

	- Most third-party security products do not start up in safe mode so the protection is negated.






# Driver Manipulation





- A Common vector is the hardware drivers that we install in our operating systems

- This is privileged code that is trusted by the OS

- Can be Trojans, RATs, or hacked driver software


## Shimming


- Shimming is the process of stealing information and money from Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, credit card readers, and ATM machines.

- The attack is common at gas stations, convenience stores, and kiosks.

- It can be an overlay attachment or sometimes and entirely replaced device.

	![Example2](https://github.com/DKC-Bluegeneral/Notes/blob/main/Images/ATM-Skimmer-Example-2.png)


## Refactoring

- Involves changing an applications source code without modifying the characteristics.

	- Often used to introduce legacy applications into new computer systems and devices. 

	- Can also re-engineer classic attack code to create variants, hybrid viruses, and worms. 




# Wireless Attacks





## Common Wireless Attacks


- Most malware attacks are multi-phased, stealthy, and polymorphic. Below is a list of some common wireless attacks:


### Evil Twins

- Evil Twin attacks involve setting up a fake wireless access point (AP) with the same SSID (Service Set Identifier) as a legitimate one, tricking users into connecting to it.

	- Examples include:

		- An attacker sets up a rogue AP in a public place, such as a coffee shop, with the same network name (SSID) as the legitimate coffee shop Wi-Fi.

		- Creating a fake Wi-Fi hotspot near an airport with a name similar to the airport's official Wi-Fi network to capture unsuspecting travelers' data.

### Rogue AP

-  Rogue APs are unauthorized access points set up on a network without the network administrator's knowledge or consent, posing a security risk.

	- Examples Include:

		- An employee brings in a personal wireless router and connects it to the company network, providing unauthorized access to outsiders.

		- A hacker installs a rogue AP in a hotel lobby, mimicking the hotel's Wi-Fi network to intercept guests' internet traffic.

### Disassociation

- Disassociation attacks force wireless clients to disconnect from a legitimate AP by sending forged disassociation packets, disrupting their network connectivity.

	- Examples Include:

		- An attacker sends de-authentication packets to users connected to a public Wi-Fi network, causing them to lose connectivity.

		- Disrupting a business's wireless network during a critical meeting by sending disassociation frames to all connected devices.

### Jamming

- Jamming attacks involve flooding the wireless spectrum with noise or interference, disrupting legitimate communication between devices and access points.

	- Examples Include:

		- A malicious actor uses a jamming device to flood the 2.4 GHz frequency band, disrupting Wi-Fi signals in a crowded area.

		- Jamming the frequency used by remote-controlled drones to prevent them from operating in a restricted airspace.

### Weak IV (Initialization Vector)

- Weak IV attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the encryption process, particularly targeting outdated encryption protocols like WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy).

	- Examples Include:

		- Intercepting and decrypting WEP-encrypted Wi-Fi traffic using tools like Aircrack-ng and capturing weak IVs.

		- Exploiting predictable IVs in WEP to launch attacks that reveal the network's encryption key.

### WPA3 attack

- WPA3 attacks target weaknesses or implementation flaws in the WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) security protocol.

	- Examples Include:

		- Exploiting vulnerabilities in the WPA3 handshake process to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to a secured Wi-Fi network.

		- Brute-forcing weak passwords protected by WPA3-Personal encryption to gain access to the network.

### Blue-snarfing

- Blue-snarfing involves unauthorized access to information on a Bluetooth-enabled device, such as contacts, emails, or files.

	- Examples Include:

		- Exploiting a vulnerability in a smartphone's Bluetooth implementation to remotely access its contact list and personal data.

		- Using specialized software to intercept Bluetooth communications between a mobile device and a car's infotainment system to steal sensitive information.

### Blue-jacking

- Blue-jacking is the act of sending unsolicited messages or data to Bluetooth-enabled devices within range, often for advertising or social engineering purposes.

	- Examples Include:

		- Sending anonymous messages or business cards to nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones in a crowded area to elicit a response or prank unsuspecting users.

		- Broadcasting promotional messages or advertisements to Bluetooth-equipped digital signage or display boards in public spaces.

### RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

- RFID attacks target vulnerabilities in RFID systems to exploit or manipulate RFID tags or readers.

	- Examples Include:

		- Cloning RFID access cards used for building entry systems to gain unauthorized physical access to secured facilities.

		- Intercepting and modifying data transmitted between RFID tags and readers in a supply chain environment to alter inventory records or steal goods.

### NFC (Near Field Communication)

- NFC attacks exploit weaknesses in NFC-enabled devices or protocols to perform unauthorized transactions or access sensitive data.

	- Examples Include:

		- Intercepting NFC payment transactions between a smartphone and a point-of-sale terminal to capture credit card information for fraudulent purposes.

		- Exploiting vulnerabilities in NFC-enabled access control systems to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized entry to restricted areas.





# Man-in-the-Middle Attacks





## MITM


- A Man in the middle can be a good (Proxy, ALG, Translators) or it can be dangerous (Proxy ARP, DHCP Spoofing)

- A system with the ability to view the communication between two (or more) hosts (frames, packets) injects itself in the path between host systems

- They are complex attacks that ban be simplex or duplex at different layers of the OSI model.


## Man-in-the-Browser Attack

- Man-in-the-Browser attack uses the same tactics as the MITM except that a Trojan horse is used to capture and manipulate calls between the main browser and its security mechanisms (or libraries) on an ad-hoc basis. 

- The most common usage is financial fraud, which manipulates transactions of Internet banking and brokerage sites. 

- Works even when other authentication factors are being used. 





# Layer 2 Attacks





## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Poisoning


- A form of MITM attack that exploits ARP

- Malicious hosts inject false frames in order to corrupt (poison) the ARP cache buffers on endpoints, switches, servers, firewalls, and routers.

- Exploit kits have several scripts, modules, and tools to compromise the ARP protocol.

- It can be mitigated with port security, snooping binding databases on switches, MACsec implementation 802.1AE


## MAC Flooding


- This attack floods a switch's MAC address table with fake MAC addresses.

- It overwhelms the switch's ability to handle legitimate MAC address mappings.

- It can lead to a switch functioning as a hub, allowing attackers to intercept network traffic.


## MAC Cloning


- This involves copying the MAC address of a legitimate device onto another device.

- It allows the cloned device to impersonate the legitimate device on the network.

- Attackers can use MAC cloning to bypass MAC address-based security measures or to conduct identity theft on a network.





# DNS Attacks





## Domain Hijacking DNS Attack


- Domain hijacking or click-jacking, is also called user interface redress attack, UI redress attack, and UI redressing.

- Hacker uses several transparent layers to trick users into clicking on a button (or link) on another web page when they were actually trying to click on the top-level web page.

- Attacker hijacks clicks meant for their page and routes them to another page, often controlled by another domain or application.

- Keystrokes can also be hijacked with skillfully constructed iframes, CSS, and text boxes. 

- This can also be done through URL redirection. 


## DNS Poisoning


 - This attack involves corrupting the DNS cache with false information.

 - Attackers can manipulate DNS records to redirect users to malicious websites.

 - It can be achieved through various methods such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning.

 - DNS poisoning can result in users unknowingly accessing fake websites or being redirected to phishing pages.


 ## Domain Reputation Attacks


 - Involves tarnishing the reputation of a domain or website to undermine trust.

 - Attackers may engage in activities like spamming or hosting malicious content to damage a domain's reputation.

 - These attacks aim to lower the credibility of the domain in the eyes of users and search engines.

 - Negative reputation can lead to reduced traffic, blacklisting by email providers, or lower search engine rankings.





 # Steps needed for a TCP Connection





1. **TCP Handshake:**

	- Initiated by the client sending a SYN (Synchronize) packet to the server.

	- Server responds with a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment) packet to acknowledge the SYN.

	- Client acknowledges the server's response with an ACK (Acknowledgment) packet.

		> SYN - SYN-ACK - ACK


2. **Data Transfer:**


	- After the handshake, data transmission occurs bidirectionally between the client and server.

	- Both parties can send and receive data packets.

3. **Connection Termination:**


	- Either party can initiate the connection termination process.

	- The party initiating termination sends a FIN (Finish) packet.

	- The other party responds with an ACK packet to acknowledge the termination request.

	- Finally, the party acknowledging the termination sends its own FIN packet.

	- Upon receiving the final FIN packet, both sides complete the connection termination.





# Risk Types





## Risk Types


- Structured Threats

	- Planned

	- Organized

	- Persistent

	- Multi-phased

	- Can be external or internal

	- Exploit Kits, zero-days, modules, and ransomware

- Unstructured threats

	- Accidental

	- Non-malicious

	- Drive-by Web Surfing

	- No AUP

	- Poor awareness

	- E-mail and web-mail

	- USB's and personal electronics

- Multi-Party Risks

	- Organizations that operate with outsourcing, suppliers, licensees, agents, and the like.

	- The frequency and scale of third-party use has grown substantially over the last two decades.

	- There is greater regulatory emphasis on how organizations manage third parties to address the inherent risks

	## Internal Risks


	- Can be introduced due to the following:

		- Poor physical security

		- Lack of additional authentication Factors

		- Non-enforcement of security policy

		- Substandard auditing and monitoring of privileged insiders

		- Poor patch, configuration, and change management

		- Lack of automated vulnerability assessment

		- Absence of endpoint detection


## Risk Management Strategies 

- Risk Acceptance


	- Do not implement safeguards
		- Justification in writing is often required

- Risk Avoidance

	- Choose not to undertake actions that reduce risk

- Risk Transference/sharing

	- Pass the risk to a third-party, such as an insurance company or a cloud service provider.

- Risk mitigation

	- Implement safeguards that will eliminate or reduce risk exposure - risk may exist, but impact is reduced


## Risk Analysis


- **Defining Risk**

	- Usually described as a percentage, or probability.

		- **Inherent** (total) risk:

			- Risk the organization faces if safeguard is not implemented

		- **Residual**:

			- Risk that remains once a safeguard is in place

		- **Residual = inherent risk-safeguards (controls)**


- **Assessing Risk**

	- What are your assets at risk?

		- Both tangible and non-tangible

		- Value

	- Identify risks to those assets

		- Vulnerability, threats, and attacks

		- Who, Why, and How

	- Only focus on risks that are likely to occur

		- Maximizes available resources

		- Focus on most likely to least likely


- **Risk Register**

	- Scatter plot/table

	- Fulfills regulatory compliance

		- Repository of identified risks, impact, scenarios, and potential responses


- **Qualitative Risk Analysis**

	- Descriptive approach using subjective opinions, history, and scenarios to determine risk levels. 

		- Expert Judgement

		- Best practices

		- Experience

		- Intuition

	- Often involves interviewing people (using Delphi methods) regarding assets, known risks, known vulnerabilities, common threats, and historical impacts.

	- Impact (Magnitude) vs. Likelihood (Probability)

		- Usually measured on a scale


## Delphi Method

- The Delphi method is a structured communication technique used to gather opinions from a group of experts on a particular topic or problem. Here's how it typically works:

	- **Selection of Experts**: 

		- A panel of experts with knowledge or expertise in the relevant field is selected. These experts may come from diverse backgrounds but share a common interest in the subject matter.

	- **Anonymity**: 

		- The experts participate anonymously, which means their identities are typically concealed from each other. This anonymity encourages honest and unbiased input.

	- **Round-Based Feedback**: 

		- The process typically involves multiple rounds of questioning or surveys. In each round, experts are asked to provide their opinions, forecasts, or evaluations on specific questions or scenarios related to the topic under consideration.

	- **Feedback and Iteration**:

	- Software that displays unwanted advertisements to users, often bundled with other software.

- **Spyware:**

	- Malware designed to secretly monitor and gather information about a user's activities.

- **Keylogger:**

	- Malware that records keystrokes typed by a user, often used to capture sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers.



## Backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RAT)

- **Backdoor Malware:**

	- Backdoor malware is a type of malicious software that enables unauthorized access to a system or network by creating a hidden entry point, known as a backdoor. Attackers exploit backdoors to bypass security controls and gain persistent access to compromised systems, allowing them to steal data, install additional malware, or launch further attacks.

- **Remote Access Trojans (RAT):**

	- Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are malicious programs that provide attackers with unauthorized remote access to infected systems. RATs typically include features for remote control, file manipulation, screen capture, and keystroke logging, allowing attackers to monitor user activity, steal sensitive information, and execute commands remotely without the user's knowledge.

- **Bots and Botnets:**

	- Bots are compromised computers or devices infected with malware that allows them to be controlled remotely by a bot-master. Botnets are networks of interconnected bots that can be harnessed by attackers to perform coordinated attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam campaigns, or credential stuffing attacks. Botnets are often used to propagate malware, steal data, or carry out large-scale cyber-crime operations.

- **Command and Control (C2 or C&C):**

	- Command and control (C2 or C&C) refers to the communication infrastructure used by attackers to remotely control and manage compromised systems or botnets. C2 servers act as centralized command hubs for issuing instructions to infected devices, receiving stolen data, and coordinating malicious activities. Detecting and disrupting C2 communications is essential for mitigating the impact of malware infections and preventing further compromise.

- **Backdoors Installed Through Misconfiguration:**

	- Backdoors can also be inadvertently created through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in software, services, or devices. Attackers exploit misconfigurations to establish unauthorized access points, bypassing authentication mechanisms and security controls. Common misconfigurations that lead to backdoor installations include default passwords, open ports, insecure network services, and un-patched software vulnerabilities.



## Rootkits

- **Local Administrator vs SYSTEM/Root Privileges:**

	- Local administrator privileges refer to the highest level of access rights granted to a user account on a local system. Users with local administrator privileges have full control over system resources and can install software, modify system settings, and access sensitive data.
	- SYSTEM or root privileges, on the other hand, represent the highest level of access rights on a computer system, typically associated with the operating system's kernel or core processes. Users with SYSTEM/root privileges have unrestricted access to all system resources and can perform privileged operations that are not available to regular users or even local administrators.
	- Rootkits are malicious software components designed to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to a system, often by escalating privileges to the SYSTEM or root level. Once installed, rootkits can conceal their presence, manipulate system behavior, and evade detection by security software, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to detect and remove.

- **Persistence Mechanisms:**

	- Rootkits employ various persistence mechanisms to maintain their presence on a compromised system even after reboots or security measures are applied. Persistence mechanisms may include modifying system files, registry entries, boot sectors, or system configurations to ensure the rootkit's persistence and resilience against removal attempts.

- **Kernel Level Rootkits:**

	- Kernel-level rootkits operate at the lowest level of the operating system, directly interacting with the kernel and system processes. These rootkits manipulate kernel data structures, system calls, and memory allocations to conceal their presence and control system behavior. Kernel-level rootkits are highly sophisticated and difficult to detect due to their deep integration into the operating system.

- **User Level Rootkits:**

	- User-level rootkits operate within user-space processes and applications, exploiting vulnerabilities in user-mode components to gain elevated privileges and execute malicious activities. Unlike kernel-level rootkits, user-level rootkits do not directly modify system components or kernel data structures, making them less stealthy but still effective at evading detection and performing unauthorized actions.

- **Memory Resident Rootkits:**

	- Memory-resident rootkits reside entirely in system memory, without leaving traces on disk or modifying system files. These rootkits inject malicious code into running processes or system memory regions, allowing them to intercept system calls, manipulate system behavior, and hide their presence from traditional file-based security tools. Memory-resident rootkits are difficult to detect and remove due to their volatile nature and ability to evade disk-based scanning techniques.

- **File System Rootkits:**

	- File system rootkits manipulate file system structures and objects to conceal their presence and control system behavior. These rootkits may modify file attributes, directory entries, or file contents to hide malicious files, processes, or network connections from users and security tools. File system rootkits can be persistent or non-persistent, depending on their ability to survive system reboots and security measures.

- **Detection and Removal Techniques:**

	- Detecting and removing rootkits require specialized tools and techniques capable of identifying stealthy and persistent malware components. Detection techniques may include memory forensics, system integrity checks, behavioral analysis, and heuristic scanning. Removal techniques may involve using rootkit-specific removal tools, bootable antivirus rescue disks, or performing system restores from clean backup images.



## Ransomware 

- **Definition and Characteristics:**

	- Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to encrypt files or block access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid. It typically exhibits characteristics such as file encryption, ransom demands, payment instructions, and deadlines for payment. Ransomware may also display threatening messages or warnings to coerce victims into paying the ransom.

- **Encryption Techniques:**

	- Ransomware employs advanced encryption techniques, such as symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms, to encrypt files and data on infected systems. Symmetric encryption uses a single encryption key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption. Encryption keys are generated by the ransomware and stored on remote servers controlled by the attackers.

- **Delivery Methods:**

	- Ransomware can be delivered to victims through various attack vectors, including malicious email attachments, phishing links, exploit kits, malicious websites, removable media, and compromised software or applications. Attackers may also leverage social engineering tactics to trick users into downloading and executing ransomware payloads.

- **Ransom Payment and Cryptocurrency:**

	- Ransomware typically demands payment in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero, to facilitate anonymous transactions and evade law enforcement detection. Victims are instructed to purchase cryptocurrency and transfer the ransom amount to a specified wallet address controlled by the attackers. Payment does not guarantee decryption or restoration of data, as attackers may fail to provide decryption keys or tools after receiving payment.

- **Impact on Organizations:**

	- Ransomware attacks can have devastating consequences for organizations, including data loss, financial losses, operational disruptions, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties. Ransomware infections may result in encrypted files, system downtime, loss of productivity, customer trust erosion, and legal liabilities, posing significant risks to business continuity and information security.

- **Mitigation Strategies:**

	- Organizations can implement various mitigation strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to ransomware attacks. These strategies may include regular data backups and offsite storage, employee security awareness training, patch management, endpoint protection solutions, network segmentation, email filtering, incident response planning, and ransomware-specific security controls.

- **Incident Response and Recovery Procedures:**

	- Effective incident response and recovery procedures are essential for minimizing the impact of ransomware attacks and restoring affected systems and data. Organizations should have incident response plans in place to guide response efforts, including containment, eradication, recovery, and communication with stakeholders. Recovery procedures may involve restoring data from backups, decrypting files using decryption tools or services, and rebuilding compromised systems from clean images.
